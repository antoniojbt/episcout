\title{Add a replicate number to rows with repeated IDs}
\usage{
epi_clean_add_rep_num(df = NULL, var_id = NULL, var_to_rep = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe object as input}

\item{var_id}{Column to use as ID, read as dataframe vector, can be index
or string. This will be used to test if row is duplicate, if it is it will add
a replicate number.}

\item{var_to_rep}{Column variable that can distinguish replicates (eg date,
'baseline' vs 'treated', etc.)}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with one column which can be merged with
existing dataframe.
}
\description{
Add a column with count of duplicate/replicate (ie for
repeated screening, replicate counts, etc.). Assumes the dataframe passed
is sorted logically with repeating IDs next to each other and
if date is used as a second ordering criteria for example,
then earlier dates are first. Useful for data with repeated
measurements but without a column/variable clearly identifying them as such.
}
\note{
Facilitates spreading a dataframe and extracting baseline vs repeated
measurement rows for example
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(tibble)
n <- 20
df <- data.frame(
  var_id = rep(1:(n / 2), each = 2),
  var_to_rep = rep(c("Pre", "Post"), n / 2),
  x = rnorm(n),
  y = rbinom(n, 1, 0.50),
  z = rpois(n, 2)
)
var_id <- "var_id"
var_to_rep <- "var_to_rep"
reps <- epi_clean_add_rep_num(df, "var_id", "var_to_rep")
reps
# Sanity check:
identical(
  as.character(reps[[var_id]]),
  as.character(df[[var_id]])
) # should be TRUE
# Bind:
df2 <- as.tibble(cbind(df, "rep_num" = reps$rep_num))
# merge() adds all rows from both data frames as there are duplicates
# so use cbind after making sure order is exact
epi_head_and_tail(df2, rows = 3)
epi_head_and_tail(df2, rows = 3, last_cols = TRUE)
