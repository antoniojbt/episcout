# Future SDD/TDD Workspace

This directory is the active planning workspace for next-phase `episcout` development. It is committed to Git but excluded from R package builds by `.Rbuildignore`.

Use this workspace for internal design notes, TDD plans, review prompts and agent handoff material. Keep executable package tests in `tests/testthat/`.

See `../PROJECT_MAP.md` for the current package and repository map.

## Directory Structure

```

## Workflow

1. Add candidate work to `TODOs.md`.
2. Promote active work to a numbered directory under `specs/`; only draft and active specs remain there.
3. Fill in `brief.md`, `sdd.md`, `tdd.md`, `acceptance.md` and `manifest.yml` before implementation.
4. Implement executable tests under `tests/testthat/`.
5. Implement package code under `R/`, `inst/` or other package directories.
6. Record review notes in the spec `review.md`.
7. Reconcile `TODOs.md`, acceptance status and `changelog.md` whenever work changes status; also check them at the start and end of each `future/` change and periodically during long-running work.
8. Move an accepted completed spec to `specs/done/`, and move a completed cross-spec review to `reviews/done/`.

## R Command Policy

Use the repo-local wrapper for R commands:

```bash
scripts/rscript_env_caller.R -e "options(repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')); devtools::test(reporter = 'summary')"
scripts/rscript_env_caller.R -e "options(repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')); devtools::check(manual = FALSE)"
```

Do not use bare `Rscript` in future specs or check instructions. For `devtools::check()`, always set an explicit CRAN mirror instead of relying on `@CRAN@`; otherwise checks can spend a long time probing repository indexes.

## Spec Status

There are no untriaged candidates under `future/ideas/`. Add new candidate work to `TODOs.md` before promoting it to a numbered specification.

### Active

- `003-large-data-backend-strategy` is active as a PostgreSQL-first extension of the existing specification-first EDA interfaces and canonical contracts. Package implementation and neutral local PostgreSQL verification are recorded; the external representative benchmark, required independent reviews and owner acceptance remain pending.

### Ready Next

- None currently; complete or deliberately stop active spec `003-large-data-backend-strategy` before activating another numbered implementation spec.

### Draft

- None currently.

### Completed

Completed specs, including accepted specs `016-longitudinal-pseudonymisation` and `017-deterministic-local-time-ambiguity`, are under `future/specs/done/`. Each spec's `manifest.yml` remains the authoritative detailed status record.
